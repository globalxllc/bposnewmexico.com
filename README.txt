# bposnewmexico v3.1

This ZIP contains a static deploy for Netlify.

**Files**
- index.html — main page with inline CSS/JS
- assets/nm-map.png — placeholder image; replace with your real New Mexico map

**Notes**
- Video sources point to your Cloudinary clip.
- The blue 'Unmute' button is the sole audio control. One click unmutes all videos and then hides itself.
- When the first (hero) video ends, the page smooth-scrolls to the second video section.
- Replace the simple JS form handler with your preferred email / Netlify form / serverless function.
