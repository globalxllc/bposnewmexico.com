BPOsNewMexico.com__v16

Changes vs v15
- Removed all "playground" assumptions & overlays; no 'file not found' UI.
- Direct Cloudinary URLs baked in for V1, V2, V3.
- V1 at ~75% width on black; Unmute unified across Chrome/Edge and hides on click.
- Right intake sized so the entire form incl. Submit is visible without inner scroll; stays static (sticky) while left auto-scrolls.
- Auto-sequence: V2 → Map (fly-in, 6s) → V3. Robust starts to avoid autoplay stalls.
- Light Edge-specific layout nudge for better fill.

Deploy
- Upload the folder or zip as-is; no edits needed.
