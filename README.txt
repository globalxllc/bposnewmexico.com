- No start button. Video 1 attempts **muted autoplay** immediately.
- **Cover image overlay** sits on top of each video and only fades out when frames are actually playing. This prevents any black screen even when autoplay stalls.
- Blue **Unmute** chip for Video 1 only; click restarts V1 with audio and removes the chip.
- Intake is sticky on the right starting in Section 2.
- Map flies in, holds ~6s, then scrolls to Video 3 (which plays below the map).

Cloudinary video links are hardwired for all 3 videos.
