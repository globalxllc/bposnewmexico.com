What's new vs v19a:
- Enforced grid min-width:0 on both columns to stop Chrome overflow.
- Clamped intake width (26â€“34rem) with Edge nudge for consistent sizing.
- Centered left cards with a safe max-inline-size clamp so V2 won't encroach.
- Map centered, portrait-safe, larger with width clamp.
- Same progressive reveal (threshold 0.40) + 300ms autoplay delay and Edge smooth-scroll fallback.
- Unmute resets & restarts V1.
