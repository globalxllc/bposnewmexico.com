BPOsNewMexico.com — v11

What changed from v10:
- **Unified flow section**: Video 2, Map, and Video 3 are now stacked in one left column with a single sticky **intake** on the right. The intake stays visible as you move past the map to Video 3.
- **Removed V2/V3 overlay covers** to prevent any visual shrinking/overlay issues; posters remain for pre-play visuals.
- **Video 2 sizing fixed** (large width), **Video 3** slightly smaller as preferred.
- **V2 autoplay hardened** (robust retries + scroll-into-view trigger). V3 is delayed until after the map’s 6s hold.
- **Map** sits between V2 and V3, sized similar to V3 with a slender aspect and fly-in animation.

Cloudinary links are embedded for all 3 videos. No “Start” button anywhere. Video 1 has a small **Unmute** chip only.
